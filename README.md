# Simple personal website

Created as a Sass practice.
Feel free to use/modify/whatever you want.

If you wish to run this on a local enviromnent, few changes to be made. This is due to how Github Pages work with project repositories.

1. Set `baseurl` to `""` in `_config.yml`
2. Change `"/simple-personal/"` to `"/"` in `assets/src/scripts/main.js`

In order to develop locally, use `gulp`. You're going to need to do a `npm install` before, obviously.
